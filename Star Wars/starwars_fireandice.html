	<p class="center">Fire and Ice<br />A POEM BY ROBERT FROST</p>

  <p> <center>(1874 - 1963)</center></p>

	<p>Is one of Frost's most popular poems.</p>

	<p>Published in December 1920 in Harper's Magazine and in 1923 in his Pulitzer Prize–winning book New Hampshire. </p>

	<p>It discusses the end of the world, likening the elemental force of fire with the emotion of desire, and ice with hate.</p>

  <p>"Fire and Ice"</p>

	<p>Some say the world will end in fire,</p>

	<p>Some say in ice.</p>

	<p>From what I’ve tasted of desire</p>

	<p>I hold with those who favor fire.</p>

	<p>But if it had to perish twice, </p>

	<p>I think I know enough of hate</p>

  <p>To say that for destruction ice </p>

  <p>Is also great</p>

  <p>And would suffice.</p>
